<center>About Me</center>
<p>       <br></p>
<p>I am Sai Akash Janapati. Currently an umdergrad at IIIT Hyderabad. I am originally from Nandyal, Andhra Pradesh, India but currently living in Hyderabad</p>
I am fascinated by the applications of Computer Vision and Machine Learning in general and currently I am trying to master them.
<p>I love solving problems that are affecting the bottom of pyramid. I strongly believe that enabling technological access to these people and providing <b>good</b> education pull out a majority of people. I hope someday, I avhieve these goals.</p>

<p>I love taking about tennis, politics and movies. Check some of my interests below.</p>

### Tennis

I have been following tennis for a long time now and lately not seeing much as many of my players have gone missing. I have been a huge fan of Angelique Kerber and Andy Murray. A lot can be learned from sports and especially from these players.

### Computer Vision

As of now, I have a broad idea what Computer Vision is and I am trying to learn detailed concepts of it. I want to write what I learnt in my <a>Blog</a>. Go and check it.

### Sitcoms and movies

I discovered the english sitcoms lately in my life and from then on, I am enjoying them. Currenly I am watching Modern family and open to any good suggestions. I generally like romcoms and thrillers. I mostly see telugu movies as it is my mother tongue.

### Books

I like reading books but it is becoming incredebly difficult to complete any of them. Currently I am reading Animal Farm by George Orwell. When it comes to movies Vs books, I prefer books.

### Communism

I don't know much about communism, but I always wanted to know what exactly it is, why did it fail, about capitalism, Fall of Soviet Union, breakup of Yugoslavia e.t.c.
